[_using GitHub as backup. This is a temporary repository_]

Still: **WARNING**

This plug-inwas built for a specific demo, it is very dependent on the runtime environement and make assumptions about it.

Ror example:

* We _must_ have a `/default-domain/Watermarks` folder with the misc. watermarks inside
* We _must_ have a "Cropped Pictures" workspace
* And some few others

Hence the "using GitHub as backup" part :-)
